# 🛡️ SentinelNet – AI Powered Network Intrusion Detection System

SentinelNet is a Machine Learning–based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that detects malicious network traffic in real time.  
It combines offline model training with live packet capture to classify network flows as Benign or Attack.  


## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time network traffic monitoring using packet capture
- ✅ Machine learning–based intrusion detection
- ✅ Binary classification: Benign vs Attack
- ✅ High accuracy (~99%) using XGBoost
- ✅ Feature importance & explainability
- ✅ Modular project structure
- ✅ Live detection with console alerts

## ⚙️ Installation

1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone [<your-repository-url>](https://github.com/aIxart-sjv/SentinelNet-NIDS)
cd SentinelNet-NIDS
```

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3️⃣ (Windows Only) Install Npcap  

Npcap is required for live packet capture.  

Download from:  
👉 [https://npcap.com](https://npcap.com)

During installation:
- ✔ Enable WinPcap compatibility mode
- ✔ Restart your system  

## ▶️ Running the Project

✅ Run Offline Detection (From Dataset)

```bash
cd src
python run_detector.py
This loads a dataset file and predicts whether flows are benign or malicious.
```

## 🌐 Run Live Intrusion Detection

Run terminal as Administrator  

```bash
cd src
python live_detector.py
```

### Now generate traffic:

Open websites  
Run ping commands  
Download files  
You will see real-time output like:  

```log
[LIVE] Flow 12: ✅ BENIGN
[LIVE] Flow 13: 🚨 ATTACK DETECTED
```

## 📈 Model Training
 
Training and evaluation are performed in Jupyter notebooks located in:  

notebooks/  

### Steps include:
- Data cleaning
- Feature scaling
- Train-test split
- Model training
- Evaluation
- Feature importance & SHAP analysis

## ⚠️ Limitations

Live detection uses simplified features for demonstration.  
Full CIC feature extraction in real time is computationally expensive.  
Encrypted traffic limits packet visibility.  
High-speed networks require stronger hardware.  

# 🚀 Future Enhancements

Multi-class attack classification  
Real-time dashboard visualization  
Automatic blocking of malicious IPs  
Deep learning models (LSTM, Autoencoders)  
Cloud deployment
